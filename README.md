# In this repo
I'm implementing multiple filters using C++. These include 
- [ ] a Kalman filter on a linear mass-spring-damper system;
- [ ] an extended Kalman filter on a Euclidean space;
- [ ] an invariant extended Kalman filter on a Lie group.

# Dependencies
* Eigen3.
* Manif (required for the invariant extended Kalman fitler).
